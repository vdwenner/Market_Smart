# Final Capstone

This is our Market Smart virtual stock market application! Built to the specifications of the project ReadMe and our project owner, we carefully crafted a simplistic
stock market simulator which allows users to create and compete in games which test their investing skills over a set period of time. We have incorporated a research tab, dynamic updating of stock prices and the ability to join and compete in as many games as the user desires!

This project incorporates Java, Spring, and PostgreSQL for the backend, while utilizing Javascript, CSS, HTML and Vue.js for the frontend.

Future plans for this application incluide: Adding a dynamic chart which would allow the user to research a stock more precisely, adding a chat functionality between users, and incorporating text alerts for leaderboard changes.
